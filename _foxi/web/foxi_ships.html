<h1><img src="./lovo_1.svg">foxi co.</h1>
<h1>Syontrix</h1>
A fully modified and custom-made Coronatrix. What if it was just 10 times capacity? Foxi has taken he OPLI modal and scaled it directly to a larger class ship.
This has allowed us to fit lots of goodies inside. The GVRN_none edition has no containment on the drive your mileage may very.

<h2>Xylophis Foxi Edition</h2>
