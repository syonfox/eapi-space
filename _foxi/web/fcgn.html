<h1>Foxi Co Galactic Network</h1>

<p>This coms system is based on the principles of hyperspace shuttles and laser ptp in system coms.</p>

<h3>Foxi hyperspace shuttle</h3>


<p>
    This communications system is based on the principles of hyperspace shuttles and laser point-to-point (PTP) in-system communications.
</p>

<h3>Foxi Hyperspace Shuttle ...  <code>Kanara (Foxi)</code></h3>
<p>
    Based on a modified Kanara (Civilian) model, some of the hull has been replaced with extra utility space for a communications module.
    The thrusters have been upgraded for increased performance at the cost of hull mass to accommodate the changes.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>-1 hull mass</li>
    <li>+2 capacity</li>
    <li>+2700,000 m/s exhaust velocity</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Equipped with a military-grade drive, the shuttle has a range of approximately 27.4 light-years.
    It can travel from Sol to Syon570 in just 5 weeks and 1 day, requiring a refueling stop at Ganinil Foxi Fuel Station.
</p>
<p>
    <h4>GaninilFoxi Fuel Station ... <code>Ganinil(4,1,1)</code></h4>
    Previously, the journey from Sol to Syon570 using the Kanara (Foxi) model took from February 19 to April 5, plus 14 hoursâ€”approximately 6 weeks.
    With the new refueling station, travel time has been significantly reduced, cutting latency to just 5 weeks.
