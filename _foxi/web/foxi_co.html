<p>We are a company made up of individuals who feel that the complexities of governance need not be so complex</p>

<p>Rules are made to control, Groups are made to divide. Individual are made slave.</p>

<p>Through simple systems for individual empowerment we aim to liberate all.</p>

<p>There is always a hope as the factions war on we may provide to all sides the tools for peace.</p>

<h4>Self Reliance</h4>

<p>Our system aims to be dependant of the other worlds. Once a member of the common wealth of independent worlds we have progressed.</p>

<p>Our home is a safe haven that balances on the line of diplomacy.  We have found a way to be of benefit to all around us.</p>

<p>By living in harmony and providing improved effeminacy of all operation from Metals Extraction, Refiling services and Transportation</p>
