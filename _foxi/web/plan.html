	So welcome to my world. I am you as you are reading.

	The first lesson of english. Always consider how your actions will be received.

	The second lesson. Do it, just do it. somthing is better then nothing.

	So please forgive my words.

	I had this idea i fell in love with. The idea that you can be free to travel.

	From the light year to the millimeter. But how.
